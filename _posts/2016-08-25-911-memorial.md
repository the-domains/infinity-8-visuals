  Gordon Huether's 9/11 Memorial measures approximately 23&amp;rsquo; H x
  25&amp;rsquo; D. The memorial was created from salvaged steel beams from the
  World Trade Center and custom designed glass panels, laminated with printed
  vinyl inner layers, listing the names of the victims. This project was a
  community effort - It was made possible by Huether, who donated materials and
  staff time in collaboration with landscape architect Gretchen Stranzl McCann
  and the City &amp;amp; community of Napa.
